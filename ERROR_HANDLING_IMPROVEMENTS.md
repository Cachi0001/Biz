# Error Handling and User Feedback Improvements

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Generic Error Messages
The application currently displays generic error messages that don't provide users with actionable information. For example:
- "Failed to save product" instead of specific validation errors
- "Error loading data" without context about what went wrong
- Missing error details that could help users resolve issues

### 2. Insufficient Validation Feedback
- Form validation errors are not always clear
- Missing field-specific error messages
- Lack of real-time validation feedback

### 3. Network Error Handling
- Poor handling of network timeouts
- No retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Unclear messaging when backend is unavailable

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Descriptive Error Messages
Implement specific error messages that tell users:
- What went wrong
- Why it happened
- How to fix it

Example improvements:
```javascript
// Before
"Failed to save product"

// After
"Product name is required and must be at least 3 characters long"
"SKU already exists. Please use a unique SKU code"
"Price must be a positive number greater than 0"
```

### 2. Enhanced Form Validation
- Real-time field validation
- Clear visual indicators for errors
- Contextual help text
- Progressive validation (validate as user types)

### 3. Better Network Error Handling
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Offline detection and messaging
- Loading states with progress indicators
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### 4. User-Friendly Error Pages
- Custom 404 pages with navigation options
- 500 error pages with contact information
- Network error pages with retry options

## Implementation Status

The following improvements have been made:
1. Added more descriptive error logging in product endpoints
2. Enhanced invoice creation validation with specific error messages
3. Improved customer and product selection feedback in forms

## Next Steps

1. Implement global error boundary component
2. Add retry logic for API calls
3. Create standardized error message components
4. Implement progressive form validation
5. Add error tracking and monitoring
