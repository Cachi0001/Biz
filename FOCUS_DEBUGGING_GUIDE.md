## 🧪 **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Open Browser Console**
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Clear the console (Ctrl+L or Cmd+K)
4. Filter by "StableInput" or "Invoices" to focus on relevant logs

### **Step 2: Navigate to Invoices Page**
1. Go to the Invoices page
2. Click "Create Invoice" to open the form
3. Watch the console for initial render logs

### **Step 3: Test Input Focus**
1. **Click on any input field** (test_input, issue_date, due_date, etc.)
2. **Watch for these logs:**
   ```
   🎯 StableInput (field_name) FOCUSED
   🎯 StableInput (field_name) CLICKED
   🌍 Global focus changed
   ```

### **Step 4: Test Typing**
1. **Type a single character** in any input field
2. **Watch for these logs in sequence:**
   ```
   ⌨️ StableInput (field_name) KEYDOWN
   ✏️ StableInput (field_name) INPUT
   🔄 StableInput (field_name) CHANGE
   ⏱️ StableInput (field_name) DEBOUNCED onChange
   🎯 field_name changed
   📊 Invoices state changed - field_name
   🏢 Invoices component rendered
   📝 InvoiceForm rendered
   ```

### **Step 5: Identify Focus Loss**
If focus is lost, look for these patterns:

#### **Pattern 1: Unexpected Re-renders**
```
🏢 Invoices component rendered #X
📝 InvoiceForm rendered
🔄 StableInput (field_name) rendered #Y
```
- **If you see many re-renders:** The component is re-rendering too frequently
- **Look for:** State changes that trigger re-renders

#### **Pattern 2: Focus Blur Without Intent**
```
🎯 StableInput (field_name) FOCUSED
👋 StableInput (field_name) BLURRED
🌍 Global focus changed
```
- **If blur happens immediately after focus:** Something is stealing focus
- **Look for:** `relatedTarget` in blur logs to see what stole focus

#### **Pattern 3: DOM Mutations**
```
🔍 StableInput (field_name) DOM MUTATION DETECTED
```
- **If you see DOM mutations:** Parent components are changing the DOM
- **Look for:** What's causing the DOM changes

#### **Pattern 4: Focus Restoration**
```
🔄 StableInput (field_name) RESTORING FOCUS
✅ StableInput (field_name) FOCUS RESTORED
```
- **If you see focus restoration:** The input detected focus loss and restored it
- **This is good:** The StableInput is working correctly

## 🔍 **WHAT TO LOOK FOR**

### **Red Flags (Focus Loss Causes):**

#### **1. Excessive Re-renders**
```
🏢 Invoices component rendered #1
🏢 Invoices component rendered #2
🏢 Invoices component rendered #3
```
- **Cause:** State changes triggering too many re-renders
- **Solution:** Optimize state management

#### **2. Parent Component Re-renders**
```
📝 InvoiceForm rendered
📝 InvoiceForm rendered
📝 InvoiceForm rendered
```
- **Cause:** Form component re-rendering unnecessarily
- **Solution:** Memoize form component

#### **3. DOM Mutations**
```
🔍 StableInput (field_name) DOM MUTATION DETECTED
mutationType: "childList"
```
- **Cause:** Parent components adding/removing DOM elements
- **Solution:** Prevent unnecessary DOM changes

#### **4. Focus Theft**
```
👋 StableInput (field_name) BLURRED
relatedTarget: "BUTTON"
```
- **Cause:** Buttons or other elements stealing focus
- **Solution:** Prevent focus stealing

#### **5. State Update Timing**
```
⏱️ StableInput (field_name) DEBOUNCED onChange
🎯 field_name changed
📊 Invoices state changed - field_name
```
- **If state changes immediately:** Debouncing not working
- **Solution:** Check debounce implementation

## 📊 **DEBUGGING LOGS EXPLAINED**

### **StableInput Logs:**
- **🔄 rendered:** Component re-rendered
- **🎯 FOCUSED:** Input gained focus
- **👋 BLURRED:** Input lost focus
- **⌨️ KEYDOWN:** Key pressed
- **✏️ INPUT:** Input event fired
- **🔄 CHANGE:** Change event fired
- **⏱️ DEBOUNCED onChange:** Debounced update sent to parent
- **🔄 RESTORING FOCUS:** Attempting to restore lost focus
- **✅ FOCUS RESTORED:** Focus successfully restored
- **🔍 DOM MUTATION DETECTED:** DOM changed around input

### **Invoices Component Logs:**
- **🏢 rendered:** Main component re-rendered
- **📊 state changed:** Specific state variable changed
- **🎯 field changed:** Input handler called
- **🚪 Dialog state changed:** Dialog opened/closed
- **🌍 Global focus changed:** Focus changed anywhere in document
- **📝 InvoiceForm rendered:** Form component re-rendered

## 🎯 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### **Normal Flow (No Focus Loss):**
1. Click input → `🎯 FOCUSED`
2. Type character → `⌨️ KEYDOWN` → `✏️ INPUT` → `🔄 CHANGE`
3. After 300ms → `⏱️ DEBOUNCED onChange` → `🎯 field changed`
4. State updates → `📊 state changed` → `🏢 rendered`
5. Input maintains focus → No blur events

### **Focus Loss Flow:**
1. Click input → `🎯 FOCUSED`
2. Type character → `⌨️ KEYDOWN` → `✏️ INPUT` → `🔄 CHANGE`
3. Something steals focus → `👋 BLURRED`
4. StableInput detects loss → `🔄 RESTORING FOCUS`
5. Focus restored → `✅ FOCUS RESTORED`

## 🚨 **COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue 1: Too Many Re-renders**
**Symptoms:** Many `🏢 rendered` logs
**Solution:** Optimize state management, use React.memo

### **Issue 2: Form Re-rendering**
**Symptoms:** Many `📝 InvoiceForm rendered` logs
**Solution:** Memoize form component, split state

### **Issue 3: DOM Changes**
**Symptoms:** `🔍 DOM MUTATION DETECTED` logs
**Solution:** Prevent unnecessary DOM updates

### **Issue 4: Focus Theft**
**Symptoms:** `👋 BLURRED` with `relatedTarget`
**Solution:** Prevent other elements from stealing focus

### **Issue 5: State Update Timing**
**Symptoms:** State changes immediately after typing
**Solution:** Check debounce implementation

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Run the test** following the instructions above
2. **Copy the console logs** when focus is lost
3. **Identify the pattern** from the logs
4. **Share the logs** so we can pinpoint the exact cause
5. **Apply the appropriate fix** based on the identified pattern

**The debugging system is now ready to identify exactly what's causing the focus loss!** 🔍
