1. Profit from sales in the sale card is not returning the actual profit from sales for both the card in the dashboard which should be returning profit for daily sales and resets at midnight and then for the one on the sales should return profit based on user choice the filter date 
2. The invoice toast CUD notification is not working analyze all invoice related file and fix this
3.The download as CSV(sales,expenses etc (ensure you find other functionalities that is not working)) is mixing contents and headers(roles and columns) together for all functionalities and all the place it's been used in the app , and also the whole download as PDF , or send that is been used (for some functionalities) in the entire app doesn't work(eg invoices)
4.invoice update doesn't work too and also push notification seemed to be complex and is not working despite being implemented in the web app
5.The setting endpoint or functionality doesn't work at all, for profile the only thing that should be editable for the user should be full name and business name other fields they should contact support which is already implemented but for other pages and tab not working at all, in the setting there is a section or page or button that says system you need to change that to the team management where owners can CRUD(activate/deactivate) for there team members based on the project PRD and once the owner is created the email_confirmed column should be true so that the user can login which is the only thing other roles should be able to do in terms of authentication and once they are logged in the dashboard according to there roles should be rendered check PRD for reference

6. On the dashboard i can see that some of the card are updating with real data like total revenue and net profit, check image.png in this current folder for reference, but the outstanding card and the 'this month' is always 0 , i want you to ensure that the calculations are working for others and i want you to tell me how the calculation works, remember the goal is to meet up with the SME painpoints, also the Powerful almighty search bar that should be capable of navigating the user to anywhere isn't currently working.

7. Please remember based on the sales being recorded both on sales page and sales report or on the dashboard there is no where that the system is calculation the profit from sales based on selling price - cost price(once sale is recorded), no where at all with filter that helps adjust dates for getting calculations .

8. The sales report endpoint is not showing any stats at all none of the buttons is working (generate sales report etc).

9. For the advance analytics the only thing that is working there is the total revenue and customers card others are just showing random charts and data.

11.The payment system is not working at all despite the fact that i placed my test paystack keys on vercel for frontend and backend check images in this directory for reference i still get a key error from paystack when a user clicks on upgrade for suscription

DISCLAIMER/INSTRUCTION: please do not assume anything if you need clarity always ask me the user before jumping and creating random files for solving a specific functionality try and make sure that you understand the current implementation and solve them step by step according to how complex they are you can create your own personal todo or use this one 'C:\Users\DELL\Saas\Biz\todo.md' and again please no local host testing just build and nodejs testing and simple testing for backends with curl or what ever that doesn't require complex setup, this file C:\Users\DELL\Saas\Biz\database_migrations\expected_columns.sql contains almost all the tables i have in the supabase but if you need clarity on what you want me to run provide it in the chat please
