# UPDATED REFERRAL SYSTEM VERIFICATION

## REFERRAL EARNINGS - CORRECTED

### Referral Earning Calculation (UPDATED)
**Only Paid Plans Generate Earnings:**
- Weekly Plan: N0 (No earnings - trial period)
- Monthly Plan: N500 per referral  
- Yearly Plan: N5,000 per referral
- Automatic tracking of referral source
- Commission rates stored for audit
- Pain Killer Strategy: Only paid subscribers generate referrals

### Business Logic Updated
- Trial users (weekly plan) do not generate referral earnings
- Only when users upgrade to Monthly or Yearly plans do referrers earn
- This encourages referrers to help convert trial users to paid plans
- Creates stronger incentive for quality referrals
