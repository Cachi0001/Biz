# SabiOps Focus Loss and Payment Issues - FIXED

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Payment Recording 500 Error** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Frontend calls `POST /api/payments/` but backend only had `/payments/manual` endpoint.

**Solution**: Added a new `POST /payments/` endpoint in `payment.py` that handles both manual and sale-related payments.

**Files Changed**:
- `Saas/Biz/backend/sabiops-backend/src/routes/payment.py` - Added new payment recording endpoint

### 2. **Focus Loss in Input Fields** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Input fields lose focus after typing single characters due to unnecessary re-renders and improper state management.

**Solutions**:
- Removed `FocusManager.preserveFocus()` calls that were causing issues
- Added `React.useCallback()` to event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Created a new `FocusStableInput` component with better focus management

**Files Changed**:
- `Saas/Biz/frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/pages/Sales.jsx` - Fixed all input handlers
- `Saas/Biz/frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/pages/Products.jsx` - Fixed form input handlers
- `Saas/Biz/frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/components/ui/FocusStableInput.jsx` - New stable input component

### 3. **Sales and Payment Correlation** ✅ IMPROVED
**Problem**: Sales and payments were not properly correlated in reports.

**Solution**: Enhanced payment recording to include proper sale references and better error handling.

**Files Changed**:
- `Saas/Biz/frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/pages/Sales.jsx` - Improved payment correlation logic

## Key Changes Made:

### Backend Changes:
1. **New Payment Endpoint**: Added `POST /payments/` endpoint that accepts:
   - `amount` (required)
   - `payment_method` (required)
   - `customer_name`, `customer_email`
   - `reference_number`, `notes`, `description`
   - `payment_date`, `status`

### Frontend Changes:
1. **Removed Focus Manager Calls**: Eliminated unnecessary `FocusManager.preserveFocus()` calls
2. **Added useCallback**: Made event handlers stable with `React.useCallback()`
3. **New Stable Input Component**: Created `FocusStableInput` with better focus preservation
4. **Enhanced Payment Correlation**: Improved sale-to-payment linking with proper references

## Testing Instructions:

### Test Focus Stability:
1. Open Sales page
2. Click "Record Sale"
3. Type in quantity field - should NOT lose focus after each character
4. Type in unit price field - should NOT lose focus after each character
5. Select product from dropdown - should work smoothly
6. Select payment method - should work smoothly

### Test Payment Recording:
1. Record a sale with any payment method except "pending"
2. Check browser console - should NOT see 500 errors
3. Check that payment is recorded successfully
4. Verify success toast appears

### Test Products Page:
1. Open Products page
2. Click "Add Product"
3. Type in product name field - should NOT lose focus
4. Type in price fields - should NOT lose focus
5. Select category - should work smoothly

## Expected Results:
- ✅ No more focus loss when typing in input fields
- ✅ No more 500 errors when recording payments
- ✅ Proper correlation between sales and payments
- ✅ Success/error toasts display correctly
- ✅ Smooth form interactions without page refreshes

## Files Modified:
