# Identified Issues in SabiOps Application

Based on the user's feedback and analysis of the provided documentation (`IMPLEMENTATION_guide.txt`, `changesMade.md`, `instruction.md`, `queriesRan.md`), the following issues have been identified and will be addressed:

## 1. Team Management (Creation, Authentication, UI)
- **Problem**: The team creation logic is not properly collecting data, and newly created team members cannot authenticate with role-based UI. The user explicitly stated: "Example in the image for team creation logic is not working it doesn't properly collect the data needed the idea is that owner can create a team memeber and based on there role after creation they can authenticate with there credentials". Also, "After team member creation can the user created by the owner login and see a different UI based on the role".
- **Expected Behavior**: Owners should be able to create team members (Admins/Salespersons) with correct data. These team members should then be able to log in and see a UI tailored to their assigned role, with appropriate access restrictions.
- **Relevant Files**: `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/pages/Team.jsx`, `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/services/api.js`, `backend/sabiops-backend/src/routes/auth.py`, `queriesRan.md` (for `users` and `team` table schema).

## 2. Products Page Blank
- **Problem**: The products page is blank when clicking on the 


create a new product button. The user stated: "Look at the products page is blank once i click on the create a new product button".
- **Expected Behavior**: The products page should display a form or interface to create a new product.
- **Relevant Files**: `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/pages/Products.jsx` (assuming this is the relevant file), `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/services/api.js`, `backend/sabiops-backend/src/routes/products.py` (assuming this exists).

## 3. Settings Section (Business Profile Data Consistency)
- **Problem**: The user questions the relevance of input fields in the business profile section and whether they match the database, backend, or JSON object expectations. The user stated: "Look at the settings section what do my users need some input fields in that business profile for? Does it match what the database(queriesRan.md), backend or the Json object is expecting".
- **Expected Behavior**: The settings section should display relevant business profile fields that are consistent with the database schema and backend API expectations, allowing users to update their business information.
- **Relevant Files**: `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx` (assuming this is the relevant file), `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/services/api.js`, `backend/sabiops-backend/src/routes/auth.py` (for user profile updates), `queriesRan.md` (for `users` table schema).

## 4. Expenses Page Blank
- **Problem**: The expenses page is blank. The user stated: "Look at how blank the expenses page is am so fucking tired of this".
- **Expected Behavior**: The expenses page should display an interface to record and view expenses.
- **Relevant Files**: `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/pages/Expenses.jsx` (assuming this is the relevant file), `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/services/api.js`, `backend/sabiops-backend/src/routes/expenses.py` (assuming this exists).

## 5. 7-Day Free Trial Logic
- **Problem**: The user mentioned the 7-day free trial but didn't elaborate on the specific issue, only expressing frustration. The `IMPLEMENTATION_guide.txt` mentions: "7-day free trial for weekly plan, inherited by team members based on owner’s remaining time; visual indicator (e.g., crown) on owner’s dashboard only."
- **Expected Behavior**: The free trial logic should correctly apply to owners and be inherited by team members, with appropriate visual indicators.
- **Relevant Files**: `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`, `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/services/api.js`, `backend/sabiops-backend/src/routes/auth.py` (for user subscription status), `queriesRan.md` (for `users` table `trial_ends_at` and `subscription_status`).

## General Issues / Areas for Review
- **Backend API Endpoints**: Ensure all API endpoints mentioned in `IMPLEMENTATION_guide.txt` are correctly implemented and accessible.
- **Frontend-Backend Data Consistency**: Verify that the frontend sends and receives data in the format expected by the backend, as highlighted in `changesMade.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_guide.txt`.
- **Error Handling**: Review and enhance error handling on both frontend and backend to provide more informative messages to the user and for debugging.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensure that role-based access is correctly implemented for team members, affecting UI visibility and backend data access.

This `issues.md` will be updated as further analysis reveals more specific problems and their root causes.
