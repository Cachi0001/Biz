# 12. Pro-rata Calculation Examples

**Detailed examples of pro-rata upgrade calculations.**

## Monthly to Yearly Upgrade
- **Current Plan:** Silver Monthly (₦4,500)
- **New Plan:** Silver Yearly (₦50,000)
- **Days Remaining:** 15 days in current month
- **Calculation:**
  - Monthly daily rate: ₦4,500 ÷ 30 = ₦150/day
  - Yearly daily rate: ₦50,000 ÷ 365 = ₦137/day
  - Daily difference: ₦137 - ₦150 = -₦13 (credit)
  - Pro-rata amount: ₦50,000 - (₦150 × 15) = ₦47,750

## Weekly to Monthly Upgrade
- **Current Plan:** Silver Weekly (₦1,400)
- **New Plan:** Silver Monthly (₦4,500)
- **Days Remaining:** 3 days in current week
- **Calculation:**
  - Weekly daily rate: ₦1,400 ÷ 7 = ₦200/day
  - Monthly daily rate: ₦4,500 ÷ 30 = ₦150/day
  - Daily difference: ₦150 - ₦200 = -₦50 (credit)
  - Pro-rata amount: ₦4,500 - (₦200 × 3) = ₦3,900

## Free to Monthly Upgrade
- **Current Plan:** Free Plan (₦0)
- **New Plan:** Silver Monthly (₦4,500)
- **Calculation:** Full amount (₦4,500) as no credit from free plan

# 14. Data Privacy & Security

**Comprehensive data protection and privacy features.**

## Contact Information Encryption
- **Phone Numbers:** 
  - Stored: "08012345678"
  - Displayed: "080****5678"
  - Pattern: First 3 digits + asterisks + last 4 digits
- **Email Addresses:**
  - Stored: "john.doe@gmail.com"
  - Displayed: "jo***@gmail.com"
  - Pattern: First 2 characters + asterisks + @domain

## Privacy Implementation
```javascript
// Phone number encryption
const encryptPhone = (phone) => {
  if (!phone || phone.length < 7) return phone;
  return phone.substring(0, 3) + '****' + phone.substring(phone.length - 4);
};

// Email encryption
const encryptEmail = (email) => {
  if (!email || !email.includes('@')) return email;
  const [local, domain] = email.split('@');
  const encryptedLocal = local.substring(0, 2) + '***';
  return `${encryptedLocal}@${domain}`;
};
```

## Data Access Control
- **Owner Access:** Full contact information for their referrals
- **Admin Access:** Encrypted contact information only
- **Salesperson Access:** No referral data access
- **System Admin:** Full access for support purposes

## GDPR Compliance
- **Data Consent:** Explicit consent for referral tracking
- **Data Portability:** Export personal data on request
- **Right to Deletion:** Remove referral data on request
- **Data Retention:** Automatic deletion after 3-month earning period

# 15. Constraints & Inheritance Logic
- **Only Owners can sign up, reset password, or create team.**
- **Admins/Salespeople can only login (must be created by Owner).**
- **Team members (Admin/Salesperson) inherit Owner's subscription plan and trial period.**
- **Dashboard is always rendered based on user role after login.**
- **All dashboard API endpoints require JWT token.**
- **All dashboard data is filtered by role in backend and frontend.**
- **UI must hide or disable sections not available to current role.**
- **All error messages must be user-friendly and surfaced in the dashboard UI.**
- **Offline/sync status must be visible if offline mode is supported.**
- **Push notifications must be enabled for all roles.**
- **Download formats are restricted by role and subscription level.**
- **Social media links are available to all roles.**
- **Toast notifications are used for all user feedback.**
- **Firebase push notifications are used for important business alerts.**
- **Free plan limits: 5 invoices/expenses monthly.**
- **Trial period: 7 days for weekly plan with crown indicator.**
- **Subscription inheritance: Team members get same access as owner.**
- **Pro-rata upgrades: Owner-only feature with Paystack integration.**
- **Usage tracking: Monthly limits enforced for free plan.**
- **Upgrade prompts: Intelligent suggestions based on usage patterns.**
- **Referral earnings: 10% for 3 months on monthly/yearly plans only.**
- **Minimum withdrawal: ₦3,000 via Paystack bank transfer.**
- **Data privacy: Partially encrypted phone numbers and emails.**
- **Payment processing: Secure Paystack integration with webhook verification.**
- **Fraud protection: Rate limiting and suspicious pattern detection.**
