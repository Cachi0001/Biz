# Reusable Dropdown Components - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates centralized, reusable Customer and Product dropdown components that can be shared across multiple pages (Sales, Invoice, Payment, Quick Actions) with a single source of truth. This ensures consistency, maintainability, and eliminates code duplication while providing a unified experience across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Centralized Customer Dropdown Component

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable Customer dropdown component, so that I can use the same component across Sales, Invoice, Payment, and Quick Action pages without duplicating code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN I import the Customer dropdown THEN it SHALL work consistently across Sales, Invoice, Payment, and Quick Action pages
3. WHEN I need to fix a Customer dropdown issue THEN I SHALL only need to modify one file
4. WHEN the Customer dropdown loads THEN it SHALL fetch customer data from a centralized service
5. WHEN I select a customer THEN it SHALL return both ID and customer object for form handling
6. WHEN the Customer dropdown displays options THEN it SHALL show customer names, not IDs
7. WHEN no customers exist THEN it SHALL show "No customers available" message

### Requirement 2: Centralized Product Dropdown Component

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable Product dropdown component, so that I can use the same component across Sales, Invoice, Payment, and Quick Action pages without duplicating code.
