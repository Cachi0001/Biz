## Technical Validation

### 1. Sales Page Error Handling
```javascript
// Before: Potential "i.map is not a function" error
const salesData = response.data.sales;
setSales(salesData); // Could be undefined

// After: Safe array handling
const salesData = safeArray(response?.data?.sales || response?.data || response, []);
setSales(salesData); // Always an array
```

### 2. Invoice Form Validation
```javascript
// Before: Basic validation
if (!formData.customer_id) {
  errors.push('Please select a customer');
}

// After: Comprehensive validation
const formErrors = invoiceValidation.validateInvoiceForm(formData);
const totalErrors = invoiceValidation.validateInvoiceTotals(formData);
return [...formErrors, ...totalErrors];
```

### 3. Error Handling Enhancement
```javascript
// Before: Generic error handling
catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error);
  toast.error('An error occurred');
}

// After: Structured error handling
catch (error) {
  const errorMessage = handleApiError(error, 'Sales Fetch', false);
  setError(errorMessage);
  setSales([]);
}
```
