# Changes Made to SabiOps Application

This document summarizes the modifications made to the SabiOps application since the instruction to follow `instruction.md` was given.

## 1. Backend: Supabase URL and CORS Configuration

*   **File:** `backend/sabiops-backend/api/index.py`
*   **Changes:** Added checks for Supabase environment variables to ensure they are properly set, addressing the `supabase_url is required` error.

*   **File:** `backend/sabiops-backend/vercel.json`
*   **Changes:** Removed explicit CORS headers to allow Vercel's default CORS handling to take over, resolving the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin header contains multiple values" error.

*   **File:** `frontend/sabiops-frontend/vercel.json`

## Verification of Authentication and Related Features

This section details the verification of specific authentication-related features as requested by the user.

### 1. Authentication Card Updates and Data Consistency

*   **Frontend (`Login.jsx`, `Register.jsx`, `Auth.jsx`):**
    *   Confirmed that the UI for login and registration forms are present and visually consistent with standard authentication cards.
    *   Verified that input fields (email, phone, password, names, business name) are correctly rendered.
*   **Backend (`auth.py`):**
    *   Confirmed that the backend expects and processes the data format sent from the frontend for registration and login (e.g., `email`, `phone`, `password`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `business_name`).
*   **Supabase (`queriesRan.md`):**
    *   Verified that the `users` table schema in Supabase, as defined in `queriesRan.md`, aligns with the data being sent from the frontend and processed by the backend, ensuring consistency.

### 2. Reset Password Functionality

*   **Frontend (`Login.jsx`, `ForgotPassword.jsx`, `authService.js`):**
    *   Verified the presence of a "Forgot password?" link on the login page.
    *   Confirmed the `ForgotPassword.jsx` component handles requesting a reset code and resetting the password.
    *   Verified that `authService.js` contains `requestPasswordReset` and `resetPassword` functions that interact with the backend.
*   **Backend (`auth.py`):
    *   Confirmed the implementation of `/request-password-reset` and `/reset-password` endpoints.
    *   Verified that the backend generates and validates reset codes, and updates the user's password securely.
*   **Supabase (`queriesRan.md`):**
    *   Verified the `password_reset_tokens` table schema and RLS policies in `queriesRan.md` for managing password reset requests.

### 3. React Toast Error Handling

*   **Frontend (`Login.jsx`, `Register.jsx`, `ForgotPassword.jsx`):**
    *   Verified that `useToast` is imported and initialized in these components.
    *   Confirmed that error messages (and success messages for login/registration/password reset) are displayed using the `toast` notification system, providing a better user experience than previous `Alert` components.

### 4. Uniqueness Constraints for Phone Number and Email

*   **Backend (`auth.py`):
    *   Verified that the `register` endpoint explicitly checks for existing email and phone numbers in the `users` table before creating a new account.
    *   Confirmed that appropriate error responses are returned if a duplicate email or phone number is detected.
*   **Supabase (`queriesRan.md`):**
    *   Verified that the `users` table schema in `queriesRan.md` includes `UNIQUE` constraints on the `email` and `phone` columns, enforcing uniqueness at the database level.

## GitHub Repository Details

*   **Repository Link:** `https://github.com/Cachi0001/Biz.git`
*   **Access Token:** `[Removed for security]`




### 5. Backend .env Credentials for Email Reset Password

*   **Backend (`auth.py`):**
    *   Verified that the `request_password_reset` function correctly retrieves SMTP configuration details (`SMTP_SERVER`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `FROM_EMAIL`, `FROM_NAME`) from `current_app.config.get()`.
    *   This confirms that the backend is set up to use environment variables for email sending, matching the format specified in your `IMPLEMENTATION_guide.txt`.
    *   Ensured that the email sending logic is in place, including `smtplib` for secure communication.




### 6. Mobile Responsiveness

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Status:** *Pending User Verification*
    *   **Note:** The agent cannot directly verify mobile responsiveness without a browser with responsive design tools. Please verify the application on various mobile devices and screen sizes to ensure a seamless user experience.
