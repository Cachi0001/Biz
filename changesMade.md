**Last Updated**: Current Session

**Critical Issues**: 0 (All Resolved)
**Payment System**: Fully Functional ‚úÖ

## [DATE: YYYY-MM-DD] Error Message Handling Improvements

### Bug/Issue
- Error messages shown to users were inconsistent and sometimes technical. Some pages used error.message, others used error.response.data.error, and not all preferred the user-friendly 'message' field from backend responses.

### Fix/Improvement
- Added a getErrorMessage utility function in src/services/api.js to extract the most user-friendly error message from API errors.
- Refactored all major pages (Customers, Products, Team, Referrals, Register, Login) to use getErrorMessage for all error toasts and error displays.
- Now, users always see the most helpful, clear error message possible, improving UX and professionalism.

## [DATE] Push Notification Triggers for Business Events
- Extended SupabaseService to send push notifications via Firebase to device tokens in push_subscriptions.
- Added notify_user helper to send both in-app and push notifications.
- Wired up notification triggers for:
  - Low stock (after stock update and after sale)
  - Payment received (after payment verification and webhook)
  - Invoice overdue (when invoice is marked overdue)
  - Referral earnings (when processed)
  - Expense limit exceeded (after creating an expense)
  - Trial expiry (on subscription status check)
- Confirmed that product stock is automatically decremented on every sale; users do not need to manually adjust stock for normal operations.

## [DATE: YYYY-MM-DD] - Fix duplicate export error in api.js
- Removed duplicate export declarations for `createSale`, `createExpense`, and `createInvoice` at the bottom of `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/services/api.js`.
- This resolves the Vercel build error: "Multiple exports with the same name ... has already been declared."

## [DATE: YYYY-MM-DD] - Fix NotificationProvider crash on null useAuth
- Updated `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/contexts/NotificationContext.jsx` to safely destructure `user` from `useAuth()` with a fallback to an empty object.
- This prevents the error: `TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'user' of 'useAuth(...)' as it is null.`

## [DATE: YYYY-MM-DD] - Align frontend auth and backend Firebase usage with implementation guide
- Refactored `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/pages/Register.jsx`, `reset-password.jsx`, `ForgotPassword.jsx`, and `email-verified.jsx` to remove all direct Supabase JS SDK usage. All authentication and verification flows now use only the backend API, as per the implementation guide.
- Patched `backend/sabiops-backend/src/services/firebase_service.py` to load the Firebase service account from the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` environment variable if present, otherwise fallback to the file. This enables secure production deployment without storing secrets in the repo.

## [DATE: YYYY-MM-DD] - Frontend updates for Edge Function integration
- Updated `email-verified.jsx` to use query parameters and show success if `?success=true` is present, matching the Edge Function redirect.
- Updated `reset-password.jsx` to prefill the email and resetCode fields from query parameters (`token` and `email`) if present, matching the Edge Function redirect.
