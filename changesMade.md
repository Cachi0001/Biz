# Changes Made to SabiOps Application

This document summarizes the modifications made to the SabiOps application since the instruction to follow `instruction.md` was given.

## 1. Backend: Supabase URL and CORS Configuration

*   **File:** `backend/sabiops-backend/api/index.py`
*   **Changes:** Added checks for Supabase environment variables to ensure they are properly set, addressing the `supabase_url is required` error.

*   **File:** `backend/sabiops-backend/vercel.json`
*   **Changes:** Removed explicit CORS headers to allow Vercel's default CORS handling to take over, resolving the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin header contains multiple values" error.

*   **File:** `frontend/sabiops-frontend/vercel.json`
*   **Changes:** Removed API proxy and headers to align with Vercel's default CORS handling.

## 2. Backend: Login Error Fix

*   **File:** `backend/sabiops-backend/src/routes/auth.py`
*   **Changes:** Implemented a check for `user_result.data` to ensure it's not an empty list before attempting to access `user_result.data[0]`. This resolved the "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" error during login.

*   **File:** `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/services/api.js`
