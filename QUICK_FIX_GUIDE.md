# 🔧 QUICK FIX GUIDE - Missing Supabase Module

## 🚨 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED:**
1. Missing `supabase` Python module
2. Still using old `bizflow-backend` directory (should be `sabiops-backend`)

## ⚡ **IMMEDIATE FIXES:**

### **Fix 1: Install Missing Dependencies**
```bash
# You're currently in: backend/bizflow-backend
# Make sure virtual environment is activated (you already have this ✅)

# Install missing supabase module:
pip install supabase

# Install all other missing dependencies:
pip install flask flask-cors flask-jwt-extended
pip install python-dotenv werkzeug bcrypt
pip install requests python-decouple
pip install openai gunicorn

# Update requirements.txt:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### **Fix 2: Quick Test (Keep Current Directory for Now)**
```bash
# Test if it works now:
python -m src.main

# OR try:
python src/main.py
```

### **Fix 3: Rename to SabiOps Directory (Recommended)**
```bash
# Go back to main project directory:
cd ../../

# Rename the directories to match SabiOps branding:
mv backend/bizflow-backend backend/sabiops-backend
mv frontend/bizflow-frontend frontend/sabiops-frontend

# Then go to new directory:
cd backend/sabiops-backend

# Activate virtual environment:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Test again:
python src/main.py
```

## 🎯 **EXPECTED SUCCESS OUTPUT:**
```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
* Debug mode: on
SabiOps SME Nigeria API is running
```

## 🔍 **IF STILL HAVING ISSUES:**

### **Check 1: Virtual Environment**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment:
# You should see (venv) in your prompt ✅ (you already have this)

# Check Python path:
where python
# Should show path to your venv
```

### **Check 2: Dependencies**
```bash
# Check if supabase is installed:
pip list | findstr supabase

# If not found, install again:
pip install supabase==1.2.0
```

### **Check 3: Environment Variables**
```bash
# Make sure you have .env file with:
# SUPABASE_URL=your_url
# SUPABASE_KEY=your_key
# SECRET_KEY=your_secret
```

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS AFTER FIX:**
1. ✅ Install missing dependencies
2. ✅ Test backend starts successfully
3. ✅ Rename directories to SabiOps
4. ✅ Continue with frontend setup
5. ✅ Deploy to Vercel

## 💡 **WHY THIS HAPPENED:**
- The `supabase` Python package wasn't installed in your virtual environment
- This is normal - we need to install all the dependencies from requirements.txt

**This is a quick fix - you'll be running in 2 minutes!** 🚀
