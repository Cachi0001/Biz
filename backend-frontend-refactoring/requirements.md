# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring the existing SabiOps backend and frontend codebase to improve performance, eliminate unused code, enhance code reusability, and establish a robust testing strategy. The refactoring will address slow CRUD operations, authentication delays, and code organization issues while ensuring zero downtime for production users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and organized backend codebase following clean code principles, so that I can maintain and extend the application efficiently without performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the current backend codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all unused files and dead code
2. WHEN refactoring CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL optimize database queries to reduce response times by at least 50%
3. WHEN restructuring the backend THEN the system SHALL implement proper separation of concerns with clear service, controller, and repository layers following clean architecture principles
4. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL create reusable utility functions and middleware components with loose coupling
5. WHEN naming files, functions, and variables THEN the system SHALL use comprehensive and descriptive naming conventions that clearly indicate purpose and functionality
6. WHEN designing modules THEN the system SHALL implement loose coupling through dependency injection and interface-based design
7. IF authentication is slow THEN the system SHALL optimize JWT handling and database lookups for user authentication
8. WHEN creating folder structure THEN the system SHALL organize code by feature and domain rather than technical layers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust testing and deployment strategy, so that I can refactor code safely without affecting production users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up development environment THEN the system SHALL provide a way to test localhost frontend with deployed backend
2. WHEN creating feature branches THEN the system SHALL establish a dev-feature branch workflow for backend testing
3. WHEN deploying changes THEN the system SHALL use Vercel preview deployments for backend testing before merging to main
4. WHEN testing refactored code THEN the system SHALL maintain API compatibility to avoid breaking the production frontend
5. IF changes affect critical paths THEN the system SHALL implement feature flags or gradual rollout mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized frontend components and code organization, so that the user interface loads faster and is easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing frontend code THEN the system SHALL identify unused components, styles, and dependencies
2. WHEN refactoring components THEN the system SHALL create reusable component libraries for common UI elements
3. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL implement code splitting and lazy loading for large components
4. WHEN restructuring frontend THEN the system SHALL organize code into logical feature-based modules
5. IF components are over 500 lines THEN the system SHALL break them down into smaller, focused components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and rollback capabilities, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues during the refactoring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying refactored code THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics comparison between old and new implementations
2. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL allow quick rollback to previous stable versions
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track API response times, error rates, and user experience metrics
4. WHEN testing in production THEN the system SHALL implement canary deployments or A/B testing for critical changes
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically alert and provide rollback recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and migration guides, so that team members can understand the refactored architecture and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive documentation of the new architecture
2. WHEN code is restructured THEN the system SHALL include inline documentation and type definitions
3. WHEN creating reusable components THEN the system SHALL provide usage examples and API documentation
4. WHEN establishing new patterns THEN the system SHALL create coding standards and best practices guides
5. IF breaking changes are introduced THEN the system SHALL provide migration guides and deprecation notices
