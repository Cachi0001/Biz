# PWA Icon Generation Instructions

To generate PWA icons in different sizes from the original sabiops.jpg file, follow these steps:

1. Copy the original sabiops.jpg file to the pwa-icons directory
2. Use an image editing tool like Photoshop, GIMP, or an online service to resize the image to the following sizes:
   - 72x72 pixels (pwa-72x72.png)
   - 96x96 pixels (pwa-96x96.png)
   - 128x128 pixels (pwa-128x128.png)
   - 144x144 pixels (pwa-144x144.png)
   - 152x152 pixels (pwa-152x152.png)
   - 192x192 pixels (pwa-192x192.png)
   - 384x384 pixels (pwa-384x384.png)
   - 512x512 pixels (pwa-512x512.png)
3. Save the resized images in PNG format with the filenames shown above
4. Ensure the images maintain a consistent appearance across all sizes

These icons will be used by the PWA manifest to display the app icon on different devices and in different contexts.

For now, we'll use the original sabiops.jpg file for all icon sizes in the manifest.json file. Once the properly sized icons are generated, update the manifest.json file to reference the new icon files.
