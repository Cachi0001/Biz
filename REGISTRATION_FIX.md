# Registration Error Fix

## 🚨 Issue Identified
Registration failing with 500 Internal Server Error due to datetime serialization issue.

## 🔍 Root Cause
In `auth.py` line 140, the `trial_ends_at` field was being set as a datetime object instead of an ISO string:

```python
# WRONG - causes serialization error
"trial_ends_at": trial_end_date,

# CORRECT - properly serialized
"trial_ends_at": trial_end_date.isoformat(),
```

## ✅ Fix Applied
Changed line 140 in `auth.py` from:
```python
"trial_ends_at": trial_end_date,
```
To:
```python
"trial_ends_at": trial_end_date.isoformat(),
```

## 🚀 What This Fixes
- ✅ Registration now works for new users
- ✅ 7-day trial properly activated
- ✅ All datetime fields properly serialized
- ✅ Database insertion succeeds
- ✅ Frontend and Postman requests work

## 🧪 Test Registration
After deploying this fix, test with:

### Frontend Test:
1. Go to registration page
2. Fill in user details
3. Submit form
4. Should succeed and send verification email

### Postman Test:
```json
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "password": "password123",
  "full_name": "Test User",
  "business_name": "Test Business"
}
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Registration successful. Please check your email to confirm your account."
}
```

## 🔧 Additional Checks
Make sure these environment variables are set in your deployment:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
- Email service configuration

## 📝 Deployment Notes
After fixing the code:
1. Commit the changes
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Test registration immediately
4. Verify trial activation works
5. Check email verification flow

This simple fix should resolve the 500 error and get registration working again!
