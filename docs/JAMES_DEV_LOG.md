- ✅ Follows existing navigation patterns

**Routing:**
- ✅ /team route is protected
- ✅ Navigation updates active states correctly

#### ⚠️ **Potential Issues Identified**

1. **Navigation Order**
   - **Issue:** Story specifies Team should be between "Sales" and "Analytics"
   - **Issue:** The global search bar shouldn't be on the         hamburger menu for mobile it should be on the top of the (header)screen and you should move the notification body and bell to replace the search bar in the mobile menu(this change is only for mobile)
   - **Current Implementation:** Shows as 5th item in mobile nav
   - **Status:** 🔍 Need to verify this matches intended position
   - **Action Required:** Confirm with requirements or adjust positioning

2. **Icon Consistency**
   - **Issue:** Story specifies UserGroupIcon but implementation uses UserPlus
   - **Reason:** UserGroup icon not available in lucide-react
   - **Status:** ✅ Resolved - UserPlus is appropriate alternative
   - **Action Required:** Update story documentation to reflect actual icon used

3. **Edge Cases to Test**
   - **User Role Changes:** What happens if user role changes while on Team page?
   - **Concurrent Users:** Test with multiple users accessing team features
   - **Session Expiration:** Verify behavior when session expires on team page
   - **Status:** 📋 Testing required

4. **Accessibility Considerations**
   - **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure team navigation is keyboard accessible

## 2025-07-25 - Team Management Form Input Focus Fix

### Issue Details
- **Related Story:** Team Management Navigation - Brownfield Addition
- **Issue Type:** UI/UX Bug Fix
- **Priority:** P1 - High
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved
- **Session Duration:** ~30 minutes

### 🐛 Problem Identified

**Issue:** Input focus loss on Team Management page form fields
- Users reported that input fields were losing focus while typing
- Form inputs would unfocus after each character typed
- Problem affected both Add New Team Member and Edit Team Member dialogs
- Issue was causing poor user experience and difficulty in form completion

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**Cause:** Inline component definition causing unnecessary re-renders
- `TeamMemberForm` component was defined inline within the main `Team` component
- Each parent component render created a new function reference for the form component
- React treated each render as a completely new component instance
- This caused input fields to lose focus and reset during typing

### 🔧 Solution Implemented

**Refactor Strategy:** Extract stable form component
1. **Component Extraction:** Moved `TeamMemberForm` outside the main `Team` component
2. **Stable References:** Created component at module level to prevent re-creation
3. **Props Interface:** Established clean props interface for form data and handlers
4. **Handler Stability:** Ensured all event handlers are passed as stable props

### 📁 Files Modified

- **Modified:** `frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/pages/Team.jsx`
  - Extracted `TeamMemberForm` as stable top-level component
  - Updated Add Team Member dialog to use extracted form with props
  - Updated Edit Team Member dialog to use extracted form with props
  - Removed inline `TeamMemberForm` definition from main component
  - Added stable handler props for all form interactions

### 🧪 Technical Implementation Details

**Before (Problematic):**
```javascript
// Inside Team component - CAUSES RE-RENDERS
const TeamMemberForm = ({ formData, onInputChange, onSubmit, onCancel }) => {
  // Form implementation
};
```

**After (Stable):**
```javascript
// Top-level component - STABLE REFERENCE
const TeamMemberForm = ({ 
  formData, 
  onInputChange, 
  onSubmit, 
  onCancel,
  onPasswordVisibilityToggle,
  showPassword,
  errors 
}) => {
  // Form implementation
};

// Usage in dialogs with stable props
<TeamMemberForm
  formData={newMember}
  onInputChange={handleInputChange}
  onSubmit={handleAddMember}
  onCancel={() => setShowAddDialog(false)}
  onPasswordVisibilityToggle={togglePasswordVisibility}
  showPassword={showPassword}
  errors={errors}
/>
```

### ✅ Verification Results

- **Input Focus:** ✅ Form inputs maintain focus during typing
