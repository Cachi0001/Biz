# Dashboard Blank Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem Identified:
The dashboard was blank due to a JavaScript error in `pageReloadPrevention.js`:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'reload' of object '[object Location]'
```

## Root Cause:
The `pageReloadPrevention.js` utility was trying to directly assign to `window.location.reload`, which is a read-only property in modern browsers. This caused a TypeError that broke the entire dashboard rendering.

## Solution Applied:
1. **Safe Property Override**: Used `Object.defineProperty()` instead of direct assignment to safely override the `reload` method
2. **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks to prevent initialization failures
3. **Graceful Degradation**: If the override fails, the app continues to work normally

## Files Modified:
- `Saas/Biz/frontend/sabiops-frontend/src/utils/pageReloadPrevention.js`

## Changes Made:
```javascript
// Before (causing error):
window.location.reload = function(forcedReload) { ... }

// After (safe):
Object.defineProperty(window.location, 'reload', {
  value: function(forcedReload) { ... },
  writable: true,
  configurable: true
});
```

## Expected Results:
- ✅ Dashboard loads normally without blank screen
- ✅ No more TypeError in console
- ✅ Page reload prevention still works when needed
- ✅ Graceful fallback if reload override fails

## Testing:
1. Refresh the page - dashboard should load normally
2. Check browser console - no more TypeError
3. Dashboard components should render properly
4. All functionality should work as expected

The dashboard should now be working correctly!
