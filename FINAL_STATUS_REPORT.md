3. **Full application functionality** - Complete business management
4. **Real-time data** - Dashboard shows actual business metrics

## How to Test the Full Application 🧪

### Option 1: Complete the Email Verification

2. Click the verification link
3. Try logging in again - it will work!

### Option 2: Create a New Test Account
1. Go to your registration page
2. Use a real email address you can access
