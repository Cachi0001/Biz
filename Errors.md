You can also see in the image the product drop down is showing the id instead of the product proper fields
check the frontend and backend implementation for this fix and help me implement it because is showing error on the cards on the dashboard 
C:\Users\DELL\Saas\Biz\frontend\sabiops-frontend\src\components\subscription\UnifiedSubscriptionStatus.jsx
C:\Users\DELL\Saas\Biz\frontend\sabiops-frontend\src\components\dashboard\AccurateUsageCards.jsx
I think these card might be for the frontend i can't remember how the backend files looks like find it and fix it please .
frontend code base is here C:\Users\DELL\Saas\Biz\frontend\sabiops-frontend and backend is here C:\Users\DELL\Saas\Biz\backend\sabiops-backend
