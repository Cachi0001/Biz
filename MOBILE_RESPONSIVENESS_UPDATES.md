# Mobile Responsiveness Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the mobile responsiveness improvements made to the SabiOps frontend application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Login and Register Forms
- **Login.jsx**: Fixed form data mapping from 'username' to 'login' field
- **Register.jsx**: Ensured proper responsive layout with grid classes
- **ForgotPassword.jsx**: Updated to use authService directly and fixed toast notifications

### 2. Table Responsiveness
- **Customers.jsx**: 
  - Added `overflow-x-auto` wrapper for horizontal scrolling on mobile
  - Hidden Business column on small screens (`hidden sm:table-cell`)
  - Hidden Address column on medium screens (`hidden md:table-cell`)
  - Made form grids responsive (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`)

- **Products.jsx**:
  - Added responsive table headers with conditional visibility
  - Hidden SKU column on small screens
  - Hidden Category column on medium screens
  - Hidden Status column on large screens

### 3. Form Layouts
- Updated all dialog forms to use responsive grid classes
- Changed from `grid-cols-2` to `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` for better mobile experience
- Ensured proper spacing and layout on all screen sizes

### 4. Toast Notification System
- Replaced broken `useToast` imports with `react-hot-toast`
- Updated all toast calls to use simpler syntax:
  - `toast.success(message)` for success notifications
  - `toast.error(message)` for error notifications

### 5. Navigation and Layout
- Verified existing mobile sidebar implementation works correctly
- Ensured proper responsive classes are used throughout the Layout component

## Responsive Breakpoints Used
- `sm:` - Small screens (640px and up)
- `md:` - Medium screens (768px and up)
- `lg:` - Large screens (1024px and up)

## Testing
- Tested on desktop viewport (1024px+)
- Tested on mobile viewport (375px)
- Verified all forms and tables work properly on both screen sizes
- Confirmed navigation and layout adapt correctly to different screen sizes

## Files Modified
1. `/src/pages/Login.jsx`
2. `/src/pages/Register.jsx`
3. `/src/pages/ForgotPassword.jsx`
4. `/src/pages/Customers.jsx`
5. `/src/pages/Products.jsx`
6. `/src/pages/Invoices.jsx`
7. `/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
8. `/src/services/api.js`

## Result
The application now provides an excellent mobile experience with:
- Responsive tables that scroll horizontally when needed
- Forms that stack properly on mobile devices
- Working authentication system
- Proper toast notifications
- Consistent mobile navigation
