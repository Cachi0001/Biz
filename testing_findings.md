# Live Application Testing Findings

## Issues Identified

### 1. Authentication Flow Problem
- **Issue**: Login shows success messages but doesn't properly redirect to dashboard
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Login form shows "Login successful!" and "Welcome back to SabiOps!" notifications
  - However, attempting to access `/dashboard` redirects back to `/login`
  - This suggests session management or authentication state is not being properly maintained

### 2. Data Schema Inconsistencies (From Code Analysis)
- **User Model Issues**:
  - Database schema has `full_name` field but model uses `first_name` and `last_name`
  - Model has `user_id` foreign key but database schema uses `owner_id`
  
- **Product Model Issues**:
  - Model references fields that don't exist in database schema
  - Inconsistent field names between model and database

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness
- **Status**: Need to test on mobile devices after fixing authentication

## Next Steps
1. Fix data model inconsistencies to match database schema
2. Fix authentication flow and session management
3. Test all CRUD operations
4. Implement mobile responsiveness improvements
5. Deploy and test final application
