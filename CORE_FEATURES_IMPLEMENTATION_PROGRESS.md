## 🔍 KEY INSIGHTS FROM REFERENCE

### Subscription Status Logic
```typescript
// From reference SubscriptionStatus.tsx
const isTrial = subscription.is_trial;
const plan = subscription.plan || 'free';
const trialDaysLeft = subscription.trial_days_left || 0;

// Different UI for each state:
// 1. Free plan → Orange warning with upgrade button
// 2. Trial active → Yellow crown with days countdown
// 3. Paid plan → Green success with billing date
```

### Upgrade Modal Features
```typescript
// From reference UpgradeModal.tsx
const plans = [
  { id: 'silver_weekly', price: '₦1,400', trial: '7-day free trial' },
  { id: 'silver_monthly', price: '₦4,500', popular: true },
  { id: 'silver_yearly', price: '₦50,000', savings: 'Save ₦4,000' }
];
```

## 📝 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Database Schema Alignment (ACTUAL CURRENT STATE)
- User table has: `subscription_plan` ('free', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'yearly'), `subscription_status` ('trial', 'active', 'expired', 'cancelled'), `trial_ends_at`
- Usage tracking: `current_month_invoices`, `current_month_expenses`, `usage_reset_date`
- Team inheritance: `owner_id` links team members to owners
- Referral system: Complete tables for referrals, withdrawals, and earnings
- Activities table: For recent activities feed (already implemented)
- Notifications: Firebase push notifications support ready
- Trial calculation: `Math.ceil((trial_ends_at - now) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24))`

### Role-Based Access Pattern
```javascript
// Current AuthContext pattern
const { isOwner, isAdmin, isSalesperson, canAccessFeature } = useAuth();

// Feature gating
if (!canAccessFeature('team_management')) return <AccessDenied />;
```
