## Key Issues Identified and Fixed:
1. **Login Issue**: Changed `email_confirmed` to `email_confirmed_at` in auth.py login endpoint
2. **Forgot Password Issue**: Changed `email_confirmed` to `email_confirmed_at` in auth.py forgot-password endpoint  
3. **Reset Link Issue**: Updated reset_link to point to `https://sabiops.vercel.app/reset-password?code={reset_code}&email={email}`

## Database Schema Notes:
- Users table has `email_confirmed_at` field (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- Email verification tokens table exists for managing verification tokens
- Password reset tokens table exists for managing reset codes

## Frontend Components Status:
- Register.jsx: Properly handles registration flow
- email-verified.jsx: Handles success/failure states from query parameters
- reset-password.jsx: Prefills email and reset code from query parameters
- Dashboard.jsx: Has proper error handling and authentication checks
