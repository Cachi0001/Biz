# SabiOps Email Confirmation Fix - TODO

## Phase 1: Clone repository and analyze project structure ✅
- [x] Clone repository from GitHub
- [x] Set up Git configuration with correct username and email
- [x] Analyze project structure and files

## Phase 2: Analyze existing implementation and documentation ✅
- [x] Read changesMade.md to understand current state
- [x] Read queriesRan.md to understand database schema
- [x] Read instruction.md for project guidelines
- [x] Analyze auth.py for authentication logic
- [x] Analyze Supabase Edge Function for email verification
- [x] Analyze frontend components (Register, email-verified, reset-password)

## Phase 3: Fix email confirmation and authentication issues ✅
- [x] Fix login endpoint to check email_confirmed_at instead of email_confirmed
- [x] Fix forgot-password endpoint to check email_confirmed_at instead of email_confirmed_at
- [x] Update reset link generation in forgot-password to point to correct frontend URL
- [x] Update changesMade.md with latest fixes

## Phase 4: Test and validate fixes ✅
- [x] Test frontend application accessibility and functionality
- [x] Verify login page structure and navigation
- [x] Verify registration page structure and form fields
- [x] Verify forgot password page functionality
- [x] Verify reset password page structure
- [x] Document test results in test_results.md
- [ ] Deploy backend changes and test complete authentication flow
- [ ] Test email confirmation flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify data parsing consistency across frontend and backend

## Phase 5: Deploy changes and report results
- [ ] Deploy backend changes to Vercel
- [ ] Test deployed application
- [ ] Report final status to user

## Key Issues Identified and Fixed:
1. **Login Issue**: Changed `email_confirmed` to `email_confirmed_at` in auth.py login endpoint
2. **Forgot Password Issue**: Changed `email_confirmed` to `email_confirmed_at` in auth.py forgot-password endpoint  
3. **Reset Link Issue**: Updated reset_link to point to `https://sabiops.vercel.app/reset-password?code={reset_code}&email={email}`

## Database Schema Notes:
- Users table has `email_confirmed_at` field (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- Email verification tokens table exists for managing verification tokens
- Password reset tokens table exists for managing reset codes

## Frontend Components Status:
- Register.jsx: Properly handles registration flow
- email-verified.jsx: Handles success/failure states from query parameters
- reset-password.jsx: Prefills email and reset code from query parameters
- Dashboard.jsx: Has proper error handling and authentication checks
