# Dashboard Search Bar Functionality Documentation

## Overview

The search bar located in the main header of the SabiOps application serves as a global search functionality that allows users to quickly find and navigate to specific data across the entire application. This document outlines the intended functionality, current implementation status, and recommended improvements.

## Current Implementation

Currently, the search bar in the Layout component displays the placeholder text "Search customers, products, invoices..." but does not have active functionality implemented. The search input is present in the header but lacks backend integration and search logic.

## Intended Functionality

The dashboard search bar should provide the following capabilities:

### 1. Global Search Across Entities
- **Customers**: Search by name, email, phone number, or company
- **Products**: Search by name, SKU, category, or description
- **Invoices**: Search by invoice number, customer name, or status
- **Transactions**: Search by transaction ID, amount, or description
- **Expenses**: Search by description, category, or amount

### 2. Real-time Search Results
- Display search results as the user types (debounced for performance)
- Show results in a dropdown overlay below the search input
- Categorize results by entity type (Customers, Products, Invoices, etc.)
- Limit results to top 5-10 per category for optimal UX

### 3. Quick Navigation
- Allow users to click on search results to navigate directly to the relevant page
- Provide keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter to select)
- Include recent searches for quick access

## Recommended Implementation

To implement this functionality, the following components and API endpoints should be created:

### Backend API Endpoint
```
GET /api/search?q={query}&limit={limit}
```

### Frontend Components
- SearchDropdown component for displaying results
- SearchResult component for individual result items
- Integration with existing Layout component

## Benefits

Implementing this search functionality will:
- Improve user productivity by reducing navigation time
- Enhance user experience with quick data access
- Provide a modern, expected feature for business applications
- Reduce the learning curve for new users

## Priority

This feature should be considered medium priority, as it significantly improves user experience but is not critical for core business functionality.
