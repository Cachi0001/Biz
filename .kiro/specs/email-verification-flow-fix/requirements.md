# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The email verification flow currently shows an error message even when email verification is successful. Users who click the email verification link see a "Verification Error" message instead of being properly redirected to the dashboard or login page. This creates confusion and a poor user experience, as users believe their email verification failed when it actually succeeded.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has clicked a valid email verification link, I want to be automatically redirected to the dashboard immediately, so that I can start using the application without any additional steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a valid email verification link THEN the system SHALL verify the email automatically
2. WHEN email verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL automatically log the user in and redirect to dashboard
3. WHEN redirecting to dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a success message "Email verified! Welcome to SabiOps!"
4. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the user SHALL have full access to all features
5. WHEN auto-login and dashboard redirect succeed THEN no manual login SHALL be required

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user whose email verification succeeded but auto-login failed, I want to be redirected to the login page instead of seeing an error message, so that I can manually log in without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email verification is successful but auto-login fails THEN the system SHALL NOT display an error message
2. WHEN auto-login fails for a verified email THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
3. WHEN redirecting after failed auto-login THEN the system SHALL show a message indicating the email was verified successfully
4. WHEN on the login page after successful verification THEN the user SHALL be able to log in normally with their credentials

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user experiencing email verification issues, I want clear and helpful error messages only when verification actually fails, so that I understand what went wrong and what to do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email verification actually fails (success=false) THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
2. WHEN showing error messages THEN the system SHALL provide clear next steps for the user
3. WHEN email verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL NOT display any error messages
4. WHEN displaying error states THEN the system SHALL include a "Go to Login" button as a fallback option
