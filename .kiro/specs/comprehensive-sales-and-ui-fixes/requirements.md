# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical issues in the SabiOps application that are preventing users from effectively managing their business operations. The problems include sales creation failures, input focus instability, broken notification system, and missing error handling throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Sales Creation System Fix

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to record sales transactions without encountering errors, so that I can track my revenue accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a product and enters sale details THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields before submission
2. WHEN a user submits a valid sale form THEN the system SHALL create the sale record successfully without "product_id is required" errors
3. WHEN a sale is created successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success toast notification
4. WHEN a sale creation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with specific details
5. WHEN a sale is created THEN the system SHALL automatically update product inventory
6. WHEN a sale is created THEN the system SHALL refresh the sales list immediately
7. WHEN a sale includes payment information THEN the system SHALL create corresponding payment records

### Requirement 2: Input Focus Stability Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want to type in input fields without losing focus, so that I can efficiently enter data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any input field THEN the focus SHALL remain on that field until the user explicitly moves away
2. WHEN a user is typing in an input field THEN the focus SHALL NOT automatically shift to other elements
3. WHEN a user interacts with dropdowns or selects THEN the focus behavior SHALL be predictable and stable
4. WHEN a user navigates between form fields using Tab THEN the focus SHALL move in logical order
5. WHEN a form is submitted THEN input focus SHALL be managed appropriately without causing UI jumps
6. WHEN a user is on mobile devices THEN touch interactions SHALL maintain proper focus behavior

### Requirement 3: Notification System Enhancement

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to receive real-time notifications about important business events, so that I can stay informed about my operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sale is recorded THEN the system SHALL display a toast notification with sale details
2. WHEN a product reaches low stock threshold THEN the system SHALL show a low stock alert notification
3. WHEN any business operation completes THEN the system SHALL show appropriate success notifications
4. WHEN any business operation fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error notifications
5. WHEN notifications are generated THEN they SHALL be added to the notification bell icon with a red badge count
6. WHEN a user clicks the notification bell THEN they SHALL see a list of all recent notifications
7. WHEN a user views notifications THEN the unread count SHALL update accordingly
8. WHEN notifications are displayed THEN they SHALL persist until manually dismissed or automatically expire

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when operations fail, so that I can understand and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields with specific error messages
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL inform users and provide retry options
4. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL guide users to re-authenticate
5. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL log details for debugging while showing generic user messages
6. WHEN operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading states to prevent user confusion
7. WHEN errors are recoverable THEN the system SHALL provide clear action steps for resolution

### Requirement 5: Data Consistency and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want my data to be consistent across all parts of the application, so that I can trust the information I see.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sale is created THEN inventory levels SHALL be updated immediately across all views
2. WHEN data is modified THEN all related components SHALL refresh to show current information
3. WHEN multiple users access the same account THEN data changes SHALL be synchronized in real-time
4. WHEN offline operations are performed THEN they SHALL sync when connectivity is restored
5. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them using last-write-wins or user confirmation
6. WHEN dashboard metrics are displayed THEN they SHALL reflect the most current data
7. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL use consistent data sources and calculations
8. WHEN API endpoints expect specific fields THEN database schemas SHALL be validated to ensure all expected columns exist
9. WHEN payment records are created THEN the system SHALL handle missing optional fields gracefully with appropriate defaults

### Requirement 7: Database Schema Alignment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema to match API expectations, so that operations don't fail due to missing columns or field mismatches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the payments table is accessed THEN it SHALL include customer_email and currency columns
2. WHEN sales are created with payment information THEN the system SHALL process them atomically to prevent partial states
3. WHEN API validation expects specific field names THEN they SHALL align with actual database column names
4. WHEN optional fields are missing THEN the system SHALL use appropriate default values
5. WHEN schema changes are made THEN they SHALL be applied consistently across all environments
6. WHEN new features require database changes THEN schema updates SHALL be documented and versioned
7. WHEN database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to developers

### Requirement 6: Mobile and Touch Interface Optimization

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the application to work smoothly on my device, so that I can manage my business on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using touch interfaces THEN all interactive elements SHALL be appropriately sized for touch
2. WHEN forms are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL be optimized for small screens
3. WHEN keyboards appear on mobile THEN the interface SHALL adjust to prevent content from being hidden
4. WHEN using mobile browsers THEN all functionality SHALL work without desktop-specific features
5. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the application SHALL handle slow connections gracefully
6. WHEN device orientation changes THEN the interface SHALL adapt appropriately
7. WHEN using mobile-specific features THEN they SHALL enhance rather than complicate the user experience
