# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The customer creation functionality is currently failing with a 500 error and "Missing Authorization Header" message. This indicates authentication issues in the API request flow that need to be systematically diagnosed and fixed. The system should reliably create customers with proper authentication and error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to create new customers without encountering authentication errors, so that I can manage my customer database effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to create a customer THEN the system SHALL include proper authorization headers in the API request
2. WHEN the authorization token is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
3. WHEN the customer creation request is made THEN the system SHALL validate the token before processing
4. WHEN the customer is successfully created THEN the system SHALL return the customer data and update the UI immediately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for authentication failures, so that users receive helpful feedback instead of generic 500 errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authentication error occurs THEN the system SHALL distinguish between missing tokens, expired tokens, and invalid tokens
2. WHEN a 401 error is received THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to login if the token is expired
3. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN the API is unreachable THEN the system SHALL handle timeout errors gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the customer creation form to validate data before submission, so that I don't encounter server errors due to invalid data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the customer name field is empty THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission and show validation errors
2. WHEN optional fields contain invalid data THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize the input
3. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL show loading states to prevent duplicate submissions
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the problematic fields with clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed logging of authentication failures, so that I can diagnose and fix authentication issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details including token status and API response
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL log request headers for debugging purposes
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages to users
4. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN the system SHALL log successful recovery actions
