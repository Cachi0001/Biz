# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive restoration and enhancement of the SabiOps business management application. The application is currently deployed and used by 15 people but has critical functionality issues including blank pages for invoices/expenses, input focus loss problems, missing toast notifications, and inconsistent user experience across devices. The goal is to restore all functionality to working order, implement proper notification systems, and ensure mobile responsiveness while maintaining the existing branding and user experience patterns.
