# Enhanced Notification System Requirements

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing notification system by adding toast notifications for critical business events and improving the notification bell functionality with YouTube-style interaction patterns. The system will provide real-time alerts for low stock, out of stock, nearing limits, and overdue invoices while maintaining mobile responsiveness and preventing Firebase notification conflicts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Toast Notification System

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to receive immediate toast notifications for critical business events, so that I can take quick action on important matters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product reaches low stock threshold THEN the system SHALL display a toast notification with product name and remaining quantity
2. WHEN a product goes out of stock THEN the system SHALL display an urgent toast notification with product name
3. WHEN a product is nearing its reorder limit THEN the system SHALL display a warning toast notification
4. WHEN an invoice becomes overdue THEN the system SHALL display a toast notification with invoice details and days overdue
5. WHEN a toast notification is displayed THEN it SHALL automatically dismiss after 6-8 seconds for warnings and 4-5 seconds for success messages
6. WHEN multiple toast notifications occur THEN they SHALL stack vertically without overlapping
7. WHEN a toast notification is clicked THEN it SHALL navigate to the relevant page/section

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Notification Bell

**User Story:** As a business user, I want a notification bell that works like YouTube's notification system, so that I can easily manage and interact with my business alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are unread notifications THEN the bell SHALL display a red badge with the count
2. WHEN the notification bell is clicked THEN it SHALL open a dropdown with all notifications
3. WHEN a notification card is clicked THEN it SHALL mark as read and navigate to the relevant page
4. WHEN a notification is unread THEN it SHALL have a visual indicator (blue dot or highlighted background)
5. WHEN a notification is read THEN it SHALL appear in normal styling without the unread indicator
6. WHEN "Mark all as read" is clicked THEN all notifications SHALL be marked as read simultaneously
7. WHEN the notification dropdown is open THEN it SHALL be fully responsive and not overflow the viewport

### Requirement 3: Mobile Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the notification system to work perfectly on my device, so that I don't miss important business alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the notification bell SHALL be easily tappable (minimum 44px touch target)
2. WHEN the notification dropdown opens on mobile THEN it SHALL fit within the screen boundaries
3. WHEN viewing notification cards on mobile THEN the content SHALL not overflow or be cut off
4. WHEN toast notifications appear on mobile THEN they SHALL be positioned appropriately and not interfere with navigation
5. WHEN scrolling through notifications on mobile THEN the scrolling SHALL be smooth and responsive

### Requirement 4: Firebase Integration Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Firebase notifications to work seamlessly with toast notifications, so that the system doesn't experience infinite refresh loops or performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase notifications are received THEN they SHALL not cause infinite page refreshes
2. WHEN Firebase and toast notifications coexist THEN they SHALL not conflict with each other
3. WHEN the system detects Firebase polling issues THEN it SHALL implement a cron job or alternative polling mechanism
4. WHEN notifications are fetched THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN the user is offline THEN the notification system SHALL gracefully handle the disconnected state

### Requirement 5: Navigation and User Experience

**User Story:** As a business user, I want notifications to take me directly to the relevant section, so that I can quickly address the issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a low stock notification is clicked THEN it SHALL navigate to the Products page with the specific product highlighted
2. WHEN an out of stock notification is clicked THEN it SHALL navigate to the Products page with filters applied
3. WHEN an overdue invoice notification is clicked THEN it SHALL navigate to the Invoices page with the specific invoice highlighted
4. WHEN a nearing limit notification is clicked THEN it SHALL navigate to the relevant limit management page
5. WHEN navigation occurs THEN it SHALL include smooth transitions or visual effects to indicate the connection
6. WHEN a notification is clicked THEN it SHALL provide visual feedback (animation, color change) before navigation

### Requirement 6: Notification Content Management

**User Story:** As a business user, I want notification content to be clear and actionable, so that I understand what needs my attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is created THEN it SHALL include a clear title, descriptive message, and timestamp
2. WHEN displaying timestamps THEN they SHALL show relative time (e.g., "2 minutes ago", "1 hour ago")
3. WHEN notification content is long THEN it SHALL be truncated appropriately with ellipsis
4. WHEN notifications are categorized THEN they SHALL have appropriate icons and color coding
5. WHEN the notification list is empty THEN it SHALL display a friendly empty state message
6. WHEN notifications exceed a certain age THEN they SHALL be automatically archived or removed
