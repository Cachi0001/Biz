# Critical UI Stability Fix Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical UI stability issues causing webpage reloads, focus loss, and display problems in the Biz application. The issues are preventing users from typing in forms and causing data display failures.

## Requirements

3. WHEN a user types in product forms THEN the input focus SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN ad scripts fail to load THEN they SHALL NOT cause page instability
5. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be contained and not cause page reloads

### Requirement 2: Fix Missing Function Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all function calls to resolve correctly, so that the application runs without JavaScript errors.

2. WHEN the sales page loads THEN all existing sales SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN sales data is fetched THEN it SHALL be properly normalized and displayed
4. WHEN API responses vary in format THEN they SHALL be handled consistently
5. WHEN sales statistics are calculated THEN they SHALL reflect accurate data

### Requirement 5: Fix Product Dropdown Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select products from dropdowns in sales forms, so that I can record sales efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sales form opens THEN products SHALL be loaded and displayed in dropdown

3. WHEN products are fetched THEN they SHALL be available for selection
4. WHEN dropdown opens THEN all available products SHALL be visible
5. WHEN no products exist THEN appropriate messaging SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 6: Fix Missing Component Imports

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components to be properly imported, so that the application renders without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Products page renders THEN StableInput SHALL be properly imported and available
2. WHEN any component uses StableInput THEN it SHALL be imported from the correct path
3. WHEN components are built THEN all dependencies SHALL be resolved
4. WHEN the application loads THEN no "component not defined" errors SHALL occur
5. WHEN imports are missing THEN clear error messages SHALL guide developers to the fix

### Requirement 7: Eliminate Ad Script Interference

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work without interference from advertising scripts, so that I can use the app reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ad scripts fail to load THEN the application SHALL continue to function normally
2. WHEN ad script errors occur THEN they SHALL NOT affect form functionality
3. WHEN monetization scripts run THEN they SHALL NOT cause page reloads
4. WHEN third-party scripts fail THEN error handling SHALL prevent cascading failures
5. WHEN the application loads THEN core functionality SHALL work regardless of ad script status

### Requirement 8: Fix API Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want API errors to be handled gracefully, so that the application remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the application SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN push notification registration fails THEN it SHALL NOT crash the app
