# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical UI issues affecting user experience in the Biz application. The problems include input fields losing focus during typing, expenses not displaying properly in the UI, and product dropdowns not showing available options. These issues significantly impact user productivity and data entry workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user creating invoices, I want input fields to maintain focus while typing, so that I can enter data efficiently without having to repeatedly click back into fields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user types multiple characters consecutively THEN the cursor SHALL remain in the same input field without requiring manual re-selection
3. WHEN a user switches between different invoice input fields THEN each field SHALL retain focus until the user explicitly moves to another field
4. IF a user is typing in an invoice field AND a re-render occurs THEN the field SHALL maintain its focus state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user creating products, I want input fields to maintain focus while typing, so that I can enter product information without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in any product creation input field THEN the field SHALL maintain focus throughout the entire input session
2. WHEN a user types multiple characters consecutively THEN the cursor SHALL remain in the same input field without requiring manual re-selection
3. WHEN a user switches between different product input fields THEN each field SHALL retain focus until the user explicitly moves to another field
4. IF a user is typing in a product field AND a re-render occurs THEN the field SHALL maintain its focus state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user managing expenses, I want to see all created expenses displayed in the main UI, so that I can review and manage my expense records effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the expenses page THEN all created expenses SHALL be visible in the main display area
2. WHEN a user creates a new expense THEN it SHALL appear immediately in the expenses list
3. WHEN expenses are displayed THEN they SHALL show complete information including category, amount, and date
4. IF expenses exist in the system THEN they SHALL NOT appear as blank or empty in the UI
5. WHEN expenses are fetched from the API THEN the response data SHALL be properly mapped to the UI components
6. IF an expense appears in "Recent Activities" THEN it SHALL also appear in the main expenses display

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user recording sales, I want the product dropdown to display all available products, so that I can select the correct product for the sale transaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the product dropdown in record sale section THEN all available products SHALL be displayed as selectable options
2. WHEN products exist in the system THEN they SHALL appear in the dropdown with their correct names and identifiers
3. WHEN a user searches or filters in the product dropdown THEN relevant products SHALL be shown based on the search criteria

5. WHEN a user selects a product from the dropdown THEN the selection SHALL be properly registered and displayed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer debugging these issues, I want comprehensive logging and error tracking, so that I can identify root causes and verify fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input focus issues occur THEN relevant events and state changes SHALL be logged to the console
2. WHEN API calls are made for expenses or products THEN the responses SHALL be logged for verification
3. WHEN UI components render THEN the data being rendered SHALL be logged for debugging purposes
4. IF errors occur during data fetching or rendering THEN they SHALL be caught and logged with sufficient detail
