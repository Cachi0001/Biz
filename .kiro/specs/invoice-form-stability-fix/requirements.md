# Invoice Form Stability and Dashboard Styling Fix Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical user experience issues with the invoice creation form and dashboard styling inconsistencies. The invoice form currently reloads when users type characters, making it unusable, and the dashboard styling doesn't match the original design reference.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Invoice Form Input Stability

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to create invoices without the page reloading when I type in input fields, so that I can efficiently enter invoice data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in any invoice form input field THEN the page SHALL NOT reload or refresh
2. WHEN I type in the description field THEN the input SHALL maintain focus and display my typed characters
3. WHEN I type in quantity or unit price fields THEN the values SHALL update without causing page refresh
4. WHEN I add or remove invoice items THEN existing input fields SHALL maintain their values and focus
5. WHEN I select products from dropdown THEN the form SHALL remain stable without reloading
6. WHEN I type in customer selection field THEN the page SHALL remain stable
7. WHEN I interact with date fields THEN no page reload SHALL occur

### Requirement 2: Dashboard Styling Consistency

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the dashboard to match the original design reference, so that I have a consistent and professional user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the layout SHALL match the original design reference provided
2. WHEN I view the dashboard on mobile THEN the styling SHALL be consistent with the reference image
3. WHEN I navigate between dashboard sections THEN the visual design SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN I view dashboard cards and components THEN they SHALL match the color scheme and spacing of the reference
5. WHEN I interact with dashboard elements THEN the styling SHALL respond appropriately without breaking the design

### Requirement 3: Form Validation Without Page Reload

**User Story:** As a business user, I want form validation to work properly without causing page reloads, so that I can correct errors efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form validation occurs THEN the page SHALL NOT reload
2. WHEN validation errors are displayed THEN they SHALL appear without page refresh
3. WHEN I correct validation errors THEN the form SHALL update smoothly without reloading
4. WHEN I submit the form THEN only successful submission SHALL cause navigation, not input validation

### Requirement 4: Cross-Browser Compatibility

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the invoice form and dashboard to work consistently across different browsers and devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the invoice form on different browsers THEN it SHALL work without page reloads
2. WHEN I view the dashboard on different devices THEN the styling SHALL be consistent
3. WHEN I interact with forms on mobile devices THEN they SHALL remain stable
4. WHEN I use touch interactions THEN the forms SHALL respond appropriately without reloading
