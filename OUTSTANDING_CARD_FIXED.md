# 🎯 Outstanding Card Fixed - Now Shows Only Overdue Invoices

## ✅ **Issue Identified & Fixed**

You were absolutely right! The outstanding card was incorrectly showing **all unpaid invoices** instead of only **overdue invoices**.

### **❌ Before (Wrong Logic):**
```python
# Counted ALL unpaid invoices as outstanding
if invoice.get('status') in ['sent', 'pending', 'draft'] and not invoice.get('paid_date'):
    outstanding += float(invoice.get('total_amount', 0))
```

### **✅ After (Correct Logic):**
```python
# Only count invoices that are PAST DUE DATE and unpaid
due_date = parse_supabase_datetime(invoice.get('due_date'))
is_unpaid = invoice.get('status') not in ['paid', 'cancelled'] and not invoice.get('paid_date')

if due_date and due_date < now and is_unpaid:
    # This invoice is overdue (past due date and unpaid)
    outstanding += float(invoice.get('total_amount', 0))
    overdue_count += 1
```

## 🎯 **Real-Life Business Logic Applied:**

### **Outstanding = Overdue Invoices Only**
- ✅ Invoice created today with due date next week = **NOT outstanding**
- ✅ Invoice created last month with due date yesterday = **Outstanding** (overdue)
- ✅ Invoice past due date but marked as paid = **NOT outstanding**
- ✅ Invoice past due date and still unpaid = **Outstanding** (overdue)

## 📊 **How It Works Now:**

### **Outstanding Card Logic:**
1. **Get all invoices** for the user
2. **Check each invoice**:
   - Is the due date in the past? ✅
   - Is the invoice still unpaid? ✅
   - If both = Add to outstanding amount
3. **Display only overdue amounts**

### **Example Scenarios:**

#### **Scenario 1: Recent Invoice**
- Invoice created: Today
- Due date: Next week
- Status: Unpaid
- **Result**: NOT counted as outstanding ✅

#### **Scenario 2: Overdue Invoice**
- Invoice created: Last month
- Due date: Yesterday
- Status: Unpaid
- **Result**: Counted as outstanding ✅

#### **Scenario 3: Paid Overdue Invoice**
- Invoice created: Last month
- Due date: Yesterday
- Status: Paid
- **Result**: NOT counted as outstanding ✅

## 🔧 **File Modified:**
- ✅ `src/routes/dashboard.py` (Lines 152-168)
- ✅ Fixed outstanding calculation logic
- ✅ Now only counts truly overdue invoices

## 🧪 **Test Your Fix:**

### **Test 1: Create Recent Invoice**
```
1. Create invoice with due date next week
2. Check outstanding card
3. ✅ Should show 0 (not overdue yet)
```

### **Test 2: Create Overdue Invoice**
```
1. Create invoice with due date in the past
2. Keep status as unpaid
3. Check outstanding card
4. ✅ Should show the invoice amount
```

### **Test 3: Pay Overdue Invoice**
```
1. Mark overdue invoice as paid
2. Check outstanding card
3. ✅ Should decrease by that amount
```
