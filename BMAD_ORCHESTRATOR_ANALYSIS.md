# BMad Orchestrator Analysis: SabiOps Role-Based Dashboard & Missing Features

## Executive Summary

As the BMad Orchestrator, I have analyzed the SabiOps codebase and identified critical gaps in role-based dashboard rendering and subscription plan management. The current implementation lacks proper role-based UI rendering, comprehensive subscription plan enforcement, and several key features outlined in the PRD.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Role-Based Dashboard Rendering (MISSING)
**Status:** Not properly implemented
**Impact:** High - Core business requirement not met

**Current State:**
- Dashboard components exist but lack proper role-based rendering logic
- No subscription plan-based feature restrictions
- Missing crown indicator for trial users
- No upgrade prompts for free plan users

**Required Implementation:**
- Dynamic dashboard rendering based on user role (Owner/Admin/Salesperson)
- Subscription plan-based feature access control
- Trial period indicators and countdown
- Intelligent upgrade prompts

### 2. Subscription Plan Enforcement (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Status:** Database structure exists but frontend enforcement missing
**Impact:** High - Revenue model not properly enforced

**Current State:**
- Database has subscription plan limits table
- Backend has some usage tracking
- Frontend lacks plan-based UI restrictions
- No pro-rata upgrade calculations

**Required Implementation:**
- Frontend plan limit enforcement
- Usage tracking and warnings
- Pro-rata upgrade calculations
- Plan inheritance for team members

### 3. Missing Core Features

#### A. Global Search Bar (MISSING)
- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Files Created:** Backend route and frontend component ready
- **Integration Required:** Add to main navigation

#### B. Push Notifications (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)
- **Status:** Service exists but not integrated
- **Files Created:** Backend service and frontend service ready
- **Integration Required:** Connect to dashboard and user actions

#### C. Team Management (BASIC IMPLEMENTATION)
- **Status:** Basic CRUD exists but lacks role-based restrictions
- **Enhancement Required:** Role-based access control and inheritance logic

#### D. Advanced Analytics (BASIC IMPLEMENTATION)
- **Status:** Basic dashboard metrics exist
- **Files Created:** Advanced analytics routes ready
- **Integration Required:** Connect to dashboard with role-based access

#### E. Payment System Upgrades (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)
- **Status:** Paystack integration exists but lacks pro-rata calculations
- **Enhancement Required:** Pro-rata upgrade logic and UI

## Database Analysis

### Current Schema Strengths:
- Comprehensive user management with role-based access
- Subscription plan tracking with trial periods
- Feature usage tracking infrastructure
- Referral system with earnings tracking

### Schema Gaps:
- Missing search logs table for global search
- No analytics aggregation tables
- Limited notification preferences
- Missing team activity logging

## Role-Based Dashboard Requirements

### Owner Dashboard (Full Access)
```javascript
// Required rendering logic
const OwnerDashboard = ({ user, subscription }) => {
  const showCrown = subscription.plan === 'weekly' && subscription.status === 'trial';
  const showUpgradePrompts = subscription.plan === 'free' || nearingLimits;
  
  return (
    <Dashboard>
      {showCrown && <TrialCrownIndicator />}
      <FinancialMetrics />
      <TeamManagement />
      <ReferralEarnings />
      <AdvancedAnalytics />
      {showUpgradePrompts && <UpgradePrompts />}
    </Dashboard>
  );
};
```

### Admin Dashboard (Operational Access)
```javascript
// Required rendering logic
const AdminDashboard = ({ user, ownerSubscription }) => {
  return (
    <Dashboard>
      <OperationalMetrics />
      <SalesAnalytics />
      <CustomerManagement />
      <ProductManagement />
      {/* No team management, referrals, or subscription access */}
    </Dashboard>
  );
};
```

### Salesperson Dashboard (Sales Focus)
```javascript
// Required rendering logic
const SalespersonDashboard = ({ user, ownerSubscription }) => {
  return (
    <Dashboard>
      <SalesMetrics />
      <CustomerList />
      <InvoiceCreation />
      {/* No expenses, inventory, or admin features */}
    </Dashboard>
  );
};
```

## Implementation Priority Matrix

### Phase 1: Critical (Immediate)
1. **Role-Based Dashboard Rendering**
   - Create role-based dashboard components
   - Implement subscription plan enforcement
   - Add trial indicators and upgrade prompts

2. **Subscription Plan Enforcement**
   - Frontend usage limit checks
   - Plan-based feature restrictions
   - Pro-rata upgrade calculations

### Phase 2: High Priority (Next Sprint)
1. **Global Search Integration**
   - Add search bar to navigation
   - Connect backend search service
   - Implement search analytics

2. **Push Notifications Integration**
   - Connect notification service to user actions
   - Implement notification preferences
   - Add real-time notifications

### Phase 3: Medium Priority (Following Sprint)
1. **Advanced Analytics Enhancement**
   - Connect analytics routes to dashboard
   - Implement role-based analytics access
   - Add export functionality

2. **Team Management Enhancement**
   - Add role-based team management UI
   - Implement team activity logging
   - Add team member status tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action Required:**
   - Create role-based dashboard components
   - Implement subscription plan enforcement
   - Add missing database tables and indexes

2. **Agent Coordination:**
   - Assign specific agents to each implementation phase
   - Set up parallel development workflows
   - Establish integration checkpoints

3. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Implement comprehensive testing strategy
   - Set up monitoring and alerting
   - Create rollback procedures

This analysis provides the complete roadmap for implementing the missing role-based dashboard functionality and core features. The implementation should follow the phased approach with proper agent coordination to ensure successful delivery.
