Password requirements strike a balance between security and usability. The system requires passwords of at least six characters, providing basic protection against common attacks while avoiding overly complex requirements that might frustrate users. The confirmation field ensures accuracy during initial password creation, reducing support requests related to forgotten passwords.

The business name field appears in the optional "Business Information" section, recognizing that some users may register before fully establishing their business entity. This flexibility accommodates entrepreneurs at different stages of business development while still capturing valuable information for users who have established businesses.

### Validation and Error Handling

Client-side validation provides immediate feedback during the registration process, enhancing user experience by catching errors before form submission. Email format validation ensures that provided addresses conform to standard formats, while phone number validation can accommodate various Nigerian number formats. Password matching validation prevents submission when confirmation passwords don't match, avoiding user confusion and potential account lockout scenarios.

Server-side validation provides the authoritative check for all submitted data, ensuring that client-side validation bypasses cannot compromise data integrity. The backend validates email uniqueness across the entire user base, preventing duplicate accounts and potential security issues. Phone number uniqueness validation serves a similar purpose while accommodating users who might prefer phone-based authentication.

Error messages are crafted to be helpful and actionable rather than merely informative. When email addresses are already in use, the system suggests that users might want to log in instead, providing a direct link to the login page. This approach reduces user frustration while potentially recovering users who might otherwise abandon the registration process.

### Account Creation and Initial Setup

Upon successful validation, the account creation process begins with secure password hashing and database record creation. The system generates a unique referral code for each new user, enabling future referral tracking and reward distribution. This code follows a consistent format that reinforces the SabiOps brand while remaining easy to share and remember.

The initial account setup establishes default settings that optimize the user experience for new business owners. Subscription status is set to "trial" with an appropriate expiration date, ensuring that users can immediately access all platform features. Default notification preferences are configured to provide helpful guidance during the initial learning period while avoiding overwhelming new users with excessive communications.

Role assignment defaults to "Owner" for self-registered accounts, providing full access to all platform features.
