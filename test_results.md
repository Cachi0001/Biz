### Key Observations:

1. **UI/UX Quality**: The application has a professional, clean design with consistent branding
2. **Responsive Design**: The interface appears to be mobile-responsive
3. **Form Validation**: All forms have proper field validation and required field indicators
4. **Navigation**: All navigation links between pages work correctly
5. **Security Features**: Password fields have visibility toggles for better UX

### Backend Integration Status:
- Frontend is properly configured to communicate with backend API
- All authentication flows (login, register, forgot password, reset password) have proper form structures
- The corrected fixes to the backend `auth.py` file and Supabase Edge Function should resolve the email confirmation issues.

### Next Steps for Full Testing:
1. Deploy the updated backend with the email confirmation fixes.
2. **Crucially, test the complete registration → email verification → login flow end-to-end.** This requires a live environment where emails can be sent and the Supabase Edge Function can be triggered.
3. Test the forgot password → reset password flow with actual email sending.
4. Verify that users with confirmed emails can successfully log in.

### Conclusion:
The frontend application is working correctly and ready for the backend fixes to be deployed. The user interface provides a smooth experience for all authentication flows. The corrections made to the backend logic and Supabase Edge Function address the `email_confirmed` boolean field directly, which should resolve the previous issues. Full end-to-end testing in a live environment is the next critical step.
